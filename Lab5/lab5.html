			<h2> Overview </h2>
			<br> <a href="https://shortiedesigns.com/2014/03/10-top-principles-effective-web-design/"> First Article On Web Design Principles </a> </br>
			<p> One article posted in 2014 has relevant data on how to create functional, well-designed websites. There are ten points mentioned and each fall into a category of the essentials, appearance, design, and miscellaneous. Of the ten points mentioned, I found myself agreeing with every point. Indeed, many of the principles discussed there have been covered in class such as purpose and communication. Without these, no one is going to be visiting your website. Typefaces, colors, and images need to be used appropriately. For example, the author talks about using sans-serif typefaces because they are easier to read on the Internet. Colors are naturally important, and we should avoid a motley of wildly different colors.  Design talks about the basics of navigation, grid layouts, and an “F” pattern design. The last one caught my attention because it was something I haven’t heard of, but for an English speaker it is important. The associated image with the below the listing helps convey the point. Finally, there is mention of load times and mobile-friendly websites. Both are helpful and almost necessary with today’s prevalence of mobile phones. </p>
			<br> <a href="https://usabilitygeek.com/12-typography-guidelines-for-good-website-usability/"> Second Article on Typefaces </a> </br>
			<p> Building off the idea of typefaces above, the type of font used is, perhaps, the most important aspect of any page. The content on any page needs to be legible and readable. One articles uses the term typography, which then sources the definition from Wikipedia saying, “the art and technique of arranging type in order to make language visible”. Furthermore, in a later paragraph of the article, they define legibility and readability. The former is “what gives you a proper visual presentation and scanning of any text”. Readability is “understanding the content”. Along with the information the article provides, they list twelve guidelines of typography. Examples include keeping the number of fonts to a minimum (no more than three), use of standard or common fonts, and using sans-serif for content. Color is also mentioned especially when it comes to red and green fonts. The two colors should not be used because some people have color-blindness. </p>

			<h2> Examples of Good Web Design </h2>
			<br> <a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/"> Spotify </a> </br>
			<p> Simplicity ranks among my most sought after features in website design. The music streaming website Spotfiy has one of the simplest, yet conveying websites. I’m not discussing the actual application here, but rather the site. The home page has a navigation bar with everything you’d expect to find in a navigation. However, if someone who knew nothing about Spotfiy, they could gather it by the homepage.  The middle of page bears the words, “Music for everyone – Millions of songs. No credit card needed” along with the link to get someone started. Assuming this person has no idea what website they stumbled upon is the description above at least gives them an idea that this is a website dedicated to music. Any further information can be reached by scrolling down or perusing the navigation bar up top. </p>
			<br> <a href="https://lparchive.org/"> LPArchive </a> </br>
			<p> I also prefer information that is readily available with functionality that is easy to use. The LPArchive compiles "Let's Plays" (often shortened to LP), which are people playing through a video game and often with commentary, from a variety of users. Much like Spotify, the website has a clean appearance. However, the look of the website is much more quaint. The navigation is situated at the top with the basics along with a reading list of current LPs. Below are featured and new LPs along with any important news off to the side. The real meat of the website is below in the table of contents along with a handy search bar. I prefer the box format especially since much of the content is text so everything is in the middle of the screen. The font size is adequate despite the font itself being serif font. Only three simple colors, which are red, gray, and white, are used so not to overwhelm the reader. </p>

			<h2> Examples of Poor Web Design </h2>
			<br> <a href="https://distrowatch.com/"> DistroWatch</a> </br>
			<p>  Many websites are simply outdated. DistroWatch is one I find myself going back to on occasion, but it is a cluttered mess at first glance. The website runs on an older version of HTML, which isn’t bad in and of itself. Indeed, the website follows the convention of a well-design website with a header, footer, body, and ancillary information on the side.  However, being outdated means it lacks the style of contemporary elements. Personally, I would set the margins between the everything a bit bigger to remove the clutter and update the color scheme, and move the search bar over to the right to keep with convention. I can see why the website is still this way though. For example, it’s probable many users of the sight prefer the older look, and it is certainly a responsive web page.  </p>
			<br> <a href="http://www.gatesnfences.com/"> Gates 'n' Fences </a> </br>
			<p> Lastly, let’s look at an actual website with terrible design all around. A gate and fence company in Florida has several aspects of their website that makes it hurt to look at. First off, the font on the page is  small and difficult to read. I have to squint or zoom in on the site to actually read any of it. The amount of information on the homepage is horribly staggering. Thankfully, there are spaces between sections, but the site itself is still cluttered and crowded with text. The images are poor quality and hovering over them brings up text that darkens and hides/changes the picture. Needless to say, the text in these pictures is also difficult to read. There is a lot that can be done with the website, but it might be better just to scrap most of the website and start from scratch. </p>
