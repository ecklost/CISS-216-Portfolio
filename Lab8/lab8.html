				<h2> Overview </h2>

				<p>With more people in the world using their mobile phones to access the web, much of the focus for website development focuses on developing for or accommodating mobile users.  Developing from the ground-up is known as progressive enhancement. The opposite is graceful degradation. Knowing your audience is key to choosing one or the other. Regardless, there are a few key principles that need to be stated when building for mobile websites. </p>

			<section id="navigation">
				<h2> Navigation </h2>

				<p>One common element of many mobile websites is bringing up navigation with three bars stacked horizontally. Each navigation section will be hidden there. According to one source, a user should be able find what they want in ideally three taps <sup><a href="#links">[1]</a></sup>. Depending on the how many menus you have, you might be able to just make the menu static.  Finally, one point to mention is that navigation bars and header sometimes travel with the user as they scroll down the page. This design choice depends on if you need screen space or not. </p>

			<section id="touch">
				<h2> Designing for Touch </h2> 

				<p>Obviously, one of the biggest differences between a traditional desktop and mobile devices how the user interacts with the computer. Designing for a user's fingers and thumbs is key. The below image is helpful to consider when creating mobile websites <sup><a href="#links">[2]</a></sup>: 
				<br> <center> <img src="thumbzone.jpg" alt="Ideal Thumb Zones"> </center> <br> Along with identifying zones where the user mostly touches, buttons and other icons that are interactable should be roughly the size of the average user's thumb. These buttons should be consistent in size as well. </p>

			</section>

			<section id="fonts">
				<h2> Fonts </h2>

				<p>Small font is detrimental for mobile websites. A user should not have to zoom into read any text on the screen. For the actual choice in font, the ideal fonts are those that are "taller and naturally structured to leave a bit of space between letters." Recommended fonts are Arial, Helvetica, Courier, Georgia, Times New Roman, and Trebuchet MS. Finally, font colors need to stand out from the background.<sup><a href="#links">[1]</a></sup> </p>
