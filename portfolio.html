			<!-- I have no idea why I put this here, but bear with me. -->
			<p> Hello! My name is Eric Klostermeyer and I am a CISS 216 (Web Development) student at Lorain County Community College. I graduated from LCCC a couple years back with my Associate's in Science. I also finished my Bachelor's of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Toledo last May. Along with all things computing, I enjoy reading and writing, baseball, basketball, and horseback riding.</p>

			<h2> <a href="Lab1/lab1.html">Lab 1</a> </h2>
			<p> The first lab required a page and some paragraphs about HTML, HTML5, and CSS. Being the first lab of the class, there isn't much to write home about it. I found it to be a fairly simple, but still a nice introduction to the class and the material. If I had to say, the absolute hardest part was determining how much I needed to type up. While the few lines I written don't seem a lot, they constitute a paragraph at the least and I thought that was appropriate. Compared to what I do now in this class, I'm impressed by the improvement I've made in almost two months time. It's only up from here.
			</p>

		<article id="lab2">
			<h2> <a href="Lab2/lab2.html"> Lab 2 </a> </h2>
			<p> For the second lab, I was tasked to choosing a topic of my choice and making a more advanced web page with headers, footers, sources, and so forth. I thought this lab was to reinforce what was learned in the first lab. Indeed, much of the design is and content reflects this. My topic was on computer security because I have a mild interest in it. For this, I used an old college text box on the topic and got my information from there. Much of the content may be outdated with attacks that are fairly rare, but I felt it was still fairly important to talk about. Overall, I didn't thing the project difficult. Really, what you see here is how I conduct most of my web pages in the future. I believe I laid the information and content down in a logical manner.
			</p>

		<section id="lab3">
			<h2> <a href="Lab3/lab3.html"> Lab 3 </a> </h2>
			<p> Here, I was tasked with improving upon the page I worked in Lab 2. I added another link that tells users how to protect themselves from online attacks. Additionally, I changed the font, background colors, and made the text justified for paragraphs. The header and footer have a white box around them to indicate a change in section. On the second page, I merely had a small page, picture and paragraph. I had wanted to combine Lab 3 and Lab 4 together in one, but I didn't feel my CSS code was complete. I merely wanted to add CSS code to work and experience in it. All in all, note that difficult to link pages especially if they are in the same folder. 
			</p> 
		</section>
		<article id="lab4">
			<h2> <a href="Lab4/lab4.html"> Lab 4 </a> </h2>
			<p> Since I had the basis from Lab 3, Lab 4 was pretty easy. I added a few things here and there and tried to make the content look and flow a bit better. Simply put, the power of CSS is incredible with what we can change on websites. Even just changing a few elements has a profound effect. At least, I'm impressed by what it can accomplish especially since the first lab was only about three weeks back at this point. Really, the hardest part was - what to change now? What else can we add? How can this look like a functional, modern website?

		<section id="lab5">
			<h2> <a href="Lab5/lab5.html"> Lab 5 </a> </h2>
			<p> Lab 5 had me searching for two websites on good website principles, two websites that had good examples, and two that were bad with them. The hardest part was finding all the information and websites. I think I did fine for the first section on finding web design principles. However, I felt my examples for good and poor web design were uninspired and just lazy choices. I really couldn't find anything I didn't like that wasn't on the 'worst web pages of all time' list and my good choices were just places I subjectively liked the design of. However, this assignment wasn't a complete bust. I did finally learn about the box format for websites. I utilized that here and enjoy the look and appearance of it. It's a format I'll keep in my toolbox.
			</p>

		<article id="lab6">
			<h2> <a href="Lab6/lab6.html"> Lab 6 </a> </h2>
			<p> Lab 6 was a bit of fun. With all the talk and design about the Tetris website Professor Zellers was doing in class I decided to talk about one aspect of my all-time favorite games, Civilization IV. I discuss a lot of my thoughts on the leader's traits. I expected the information to be fairly obtuse to someone who's never played the game. My hope with this page is to expand upon it or add to it in case I do my project on the game. 
			</p>
			<p> However, the main focus of this lab was to prototype between two different pages. I made both pages a little different. I kept the box format and some other minor details. The most noticeable difference is the background image and that the second page has a following navigation. For me, the hardest part was deciding what elements to change. The first page, which is the one with a screenshot of the game as a background image, was fairly complete since I borrowed most of the elements and aspects from Lab 5. My hope for the second page then was to make it more subdued and less busy. I also tried using some of the main colors from the game. Despite the amount of content I had to create, I had fun with this lab and I continue to have fun with developing in HTML and CSS.
			</p>

		<section id="lab7">
			<h2> <a href="Lab7/lab7.html"> Lab 7 </a> </h2>
			<p> According to the assignment, we were to build upon the skills we had learned recently. However, based on the requirements of the assignment, I didn't feel there was much to add beyond what was already done. There are some slight differences between this lab and Lab 6, but the general content and layout is the same. Overall, it was not too difficult of an assignment based on what was mentioned. </p>
		</section>
		<article id="lab8">
			<h2> <a href="Lab8/lab8.html"> Lab 8 </a> </h2>
			<p> This is one of my more favorite assignments. It's not so much the design and layout, but because by this point in the semester, the class was getting to the meat of HTML. In particular, learning how to make responsive pages is an incredible tool to use especially with the world becoming more and more on mobile and tablet devices. Additionally, learning about user accessibility is important to know too in order to aid those who might be temporary or permanently impaired. Once I found the information, the hardest part was putting the two web pages together. I opted to use a completely mobile set-up (and therefore, a progressive enhancement set-up). </p>
		</article>
		<section id="lab9">
			<h2> <a href="Lab9/lab9.html"> Lab 9 </a> </h2>
			<p> Lab 9 was the class's introduction into forms. Overall, the concept and utilization of it wasn't too difficult. The only difficult part would be to make a script that takes the form and do what we want it to do. Since the lab only required to create a form and send it off to the URL, it made the lab relatively painless. The use of most form elements such as textboxes, radio buttons, and so forth were covered, and necessary to complete the assignment. Along with it being easy, it was also a fun lab to do. </p>
		</section>
		<article id="lab10">
			<h2> <a href="Lab10/lab10.html"> Lab 10 </a> </h2>
			<p> Lab 10 focused on tables in HTML. Overall, this lab wasn't too hard to complete. The table was fairly easy to set-up after looking at how to do tables. Finding links on mobile usage wasn't difficult either since viewing web content over mobile is becoming bigger and bigger. The hardest part is if I added enough content. As I can recall, all that was needed to add was the table listed in the project description and at least three other links relating to mobile usage. Because of this uncertainty, the page is rather barebones. </p>
		</article>
		<section id="lab11">
			<h2> <a href="Lab11/lab11.html"> Lab 11 </a> </h2>
			<p> For the final lab of the class, I decided to do some JavaScript code for one of the web pages on my semester project. I wasn't sure what to add at first, but I figured a search functionality of some sort would be best. The purpose of this was two-fold. I needed to add some type of searching to complete the semester project, and Lab 11 asks for the use of JavaScript. Pllus, I thought this was a nice 'update' of sorts and what's to come for the final submission of the project. Overall, adding JavaScript wasn't difficult and it certainly makes the page flow quite nicely. </p>
