			<h2> Browser Attacks </h2>
			<p> The main goal behind browser attacks is for gathering sensitive information. The methods vary, but some ways to attract gullible users include pop-up ads and installing malware. some examples include man-in-the-browser, keystroke logging, and program download substitutions. Man-in-the-browser attacks consist of injected code into a browser that reads, copies, and redistributes anything a user enters. It comes to users typically as a Trojan horse. In one infamous case, SilentBanker was able to obtain key bank information from users. SilentBanker set itself up to look like a legitimate banking website, redirecting the user from banking websites. SSL and HTTPS encryptions were useless because the infected browser gathered the information before it was encrypted. Keystroke logging is similiar to man-in-the-browser attacks. It is either software or hardware designed to capture keystrokes. Information is gathered and then later retrieved. Finally, program download substitutions and is usually coupled with man-in-the-browser attacks. Here, the user agrees to install a program on their browser (e.g. toolbar), which contains malicious code. It bypasses all access controls because the user has agreed to letting the program do so when they installed it.

			<h2> Misleading Web Attacks </h2>
			<p>	Web attacks fall under two categories: misleading or malicious. The first looked at here is false content. One of the simplest is website defacement. The reasons behind such an attack vary, whether it is for hacking it for the sake of haking, embarrassing the victume, or attempting to obtain user information from fake login boxes. As such, the integrity of a web page is affected. Fake websites are also of concern and are easy to fake. Attackers can simply copy the images from the real website and create a copy straight from the source code. With the code and images, the user can redirect users with malicious links. Fake code is another way to mislead users. The website looks to have a legitimate program to download, and often does have a piece of software that claims what it does, but has malicious code running in the background.

			<h2> Malicious Web Attacks </h2>
			<p> Obviously, web attacks can also be malicious rather than mislead. Web bugs, also called 1x1 GIF take up only one pixel on the screen and are not noticeable usually. In the background, they run a program that track users. While not necessarily malicious, it is an invasion of privacy. Clickjacking is another concern on the web. Essentially, the assailant will trick a user into clicking on a link by disguising what the link is pointed to. So, let's assume a pop-up box says "Click Yes for Free Stock Images." The yes button the user sees has no functionality, but a separate pop-up box behind that has the code to delete a user's Windows32 folder. Drive-by downloading is similiar to clickjacking. For example, a user might haphazardly go to a shady postal website only to reach a 404 page with malicious code. Once there, the code downloads itself onto the browser and/or operating system, bypassing user permissions. </p>
