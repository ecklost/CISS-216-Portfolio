		<p> For browser attacks, attacks succeed based on failed identification and authentication. Identification is asserting who a person is while authentication is proving that asserted identity. There are three examples that can succeed in both identification and authenticity. The first are shared secrets, which are basically questions a website asks such as mother's maiden name. However, shared secrets lose strength the more websites that use them. The next are one-time passwords, which can exist in forms of real-life tokens (i.e. SecurID) or banks sending out temporary codes for a user to sign in on. In fact, the latter is an example of a third way to prove identification and authenticity - out-of-band communications. A lot of the codes sent out from a bank can be sent via a text or phone call.

		<p> Protecting against misleading web attacks involves two methods. The first are integrity checksums. Basically, integrity checksums detect whenever there is altered content on a web site. The Tripwire program is one such piece of software. Each time data or a piece of code is altered, a new hash value is generated. These values must then be stored offline and away from the network. Any changes to the web site require these checksums, and an administrator will know if anything is altered. While integrity checksums are good for the server-side administrator, the client has no assurance the web site is misleading; therefore, digital signatures exist. The signature is a voucher for the authenticity of a program or update. However, it is up to the client to trust the legitimacy of the signer.
		</p>
		<p> The basic defense against malicious web attacks lie in access control. Users should restrict administrative privileges for all installing programs, and only allowing a program to install from a trusted source. Also, web site owners need to ensure the code put up on their web sites do not harm users downloading or using the code. However, beyond this, there isn't much that can be done. Therefore, user vigilance and careful access control are the best defenses against such attacks.
