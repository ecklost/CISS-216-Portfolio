			<h2> HTML </h2>
				<p> HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. Here, hypertext refers to beyond what is needed. Markup refers marking important information on a website using tags. Tags can designate anything from a new paragraph, to a header, to a link to another website and so forth. Thus, HTML can be summarized as the structure or skeleton that holds a webpage together. </p>

			<h2> HTML5 </h2>
				<p> HTML5 is the latest iteration of HTML. HTML5 contains three types of code: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. One of the wonderful aspects of it is that it is royalty-free, so someone using HTML5 for websites doesn't have to pay anyone for its use. It's also cross platform, which means that any device that supports HTML5 will be able to display webpages. </p>

			<h2> CSS </h2>
				<p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet. Essentially, this controls how elements on a webpage look. Using text as an example, with CSS we can control the type of font (Arial, Times New Roman, etc), the font size, if it's bolded, and so on. While CSS has use in webpages, object-oriented programming languages such as Java can use it to control elements for applications.</p>
