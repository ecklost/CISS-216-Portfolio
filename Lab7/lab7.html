			<h2> Overview </h2>
			<p> One of my most played games in recent years has been Civilization IV with all of the expansions included. Each leader in the game has two traits, which define how the game should be played. Some leaders lend themselves to being being more peaceful as opposed to martial. Others include to leading a  sprawling empire or generating great people. In the end, the game comes back to best utilizing your economy, and traits play a major part in that. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="aggressive">
			<h2> Aggressive </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Free Combat I promotion of melee and gunpowder units.
				<li> 100% production bonus of Barracks and Drydocks.
			</ul>
			<p>	As the name implies, aggressive leaders are best suited for going to war. Naturally, waring early and often is the best way to use this trait. However, the trait itself is rather weak because it there is no direct effect to the economy. Indirectly, the idea is that you need less troops overall to take over another civilization, thus reducing unit maintenance. Additionally, taking more cities helps you in the long run with the economy, provided you can hold the cities you take. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="charismatic">
			<h2> Charismatic </h2>
			<ul> 
				<li> +1 Happiness per city
				<li> 25% less experience needed for unit promotions
				<li> +1 Happiness from Monuments and Broadcast Towers
			</ul>
			<p> Charismatic is a decent trait to have. Happiness is a major limiter in how big your cities can grow and an extra point for each city helps them grow a bit bigger meaning they can work more tiles and help fuel your economy. Additionally, all three advantages are helpful in war time in dealing with war weariness and unit promotions coming sooner and more ready for troops created or drafted. <p>
		</section>
		<section id="creative">
			<h2> Creative </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> +2 Culture generation per turn
				<li> 100% production bonus of Libraries, Theaters, and Colosseums
			</ul>
			<p> Culture is definitely a trait useful in the early game and tends to being a more of a non-factor as the game goes on. The culture boost in the early game is great for grabbing all of your available resources in your cities’ radius without building a culture building like a Monument or Library early in the game. That production can be used to getting out another unit, focusing on a wonder, etc. The half-cost Libraries and Theaters are good for an early game tech advantage and culture generation in general. Colosseums are less used, but are helpful for the happiness bonus for larger cities. <p>
		</section>
		<section id="expansive">
			<h2> Expansive </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> +2 Health per city
				<li> 25% production bonus of Workers
				<li> 100% production bonus of Granaries and Harbors
			</ul>
			<p> Expansive, rather than spread cities, means here growth in cities. The trait itself quite great. The +2 Health essentially translates to +2 extra food, and is useful to have as the game goes on and your cities become more and more unhealthy due to certain buildings and for cities on flood plains. The extra production on Workers is helpful in the early game in getting your resources on-line. The extra hammers saved here and with Granaries and Harbors will help your cities grow, flourish, and remain healthy. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="financial">
			<h2> Financial </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> +1 extra commerce on tiles with +2 commerce
			</ul>
			<p> Financial is one of, if not, the best trait for a leader to have. Because your science and research rating is tied with your economy, extra gold generation will lead to researching technologies faster. Beyond that, extra commerce affects everything from being able to maintain a standing army, paying for items in trades, and so forth. Developing and building cottages in the early game pays dividends in the future when they become towns. It’s an easy bonus to utilize and a welcome one. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="imperialistic">
			<h2> Imperialistic </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Great General emergence rate increased by 100%
				<li> Settler production bonus of +50%
			</ul>
			<p> This trait is okay, but to get the full benefit of it, you need to go to war. Early on, the extra boost to building settlers is helpful to getting cities up. However, the first part of the trait only activates during wartime when you’re units are fighting other civilizations. Great Generals are certainly useful for any martial civilization to have, and aid in any conquest (be the only civilization left) or domination victory. (acquire a certain amount of land and world population). If you’re not warring, then you’re not using this trait. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="industrious">
			<h2> Industrious </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Wonder production bonus of 50%
				<li> Forge production bonus of 100%
			</ul>
			<p> Industrious leaders are excellent and almost rival Financial ones. The extra wonder production is key to acquiring key wonders throughout the game. Even wonders that you wouldn’t normally make are great to build, stop just before they are built and let someone else build them for the gold you get from not completing it in time. Faster forges will also help your cities’ buildings and units out faster. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="organized">
			<h2> Organized </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Civic Upkeep reduced by 50%
				<li> Lighthouse, Courthouse, and Factory production bonus of 100%
			</ul>
			<p> Organized is useful for the flexibility it offers, but it best works for martial and/or large empires. It lets you run the more taxing civics (Vassalage, Bureaucracy, Organized Religion and Police State) without crashing your economy. Courthouses are useful to build in faraway cities or ones that you conquered. Lighthouses are necessary for coastal cities, so the bonus there is nice to get extra food in. Faster Factories are a mixed bag because they come rather late in the game and by that point you can probably just buy them than rather build them. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="philosophical">
			<h2> Philosophical </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Great Person generation increased by 100%
				<li> University production bonus of 100%
			</ul>
			<p> Philosophical is one of the top-tier traits. In general, the type of economy you want to run with them is a specialist economy, getting the great scientists that you need. Over time, the bonus starts to wane as great people become more and more expensive the more you recruit. Ideally, you’ll want to take key civics (Pacifism for the additional Great Person Bonus)  and wonders (The Great Library, Parthenon). The production bonus to Universities is nice to have as that’s a building you should be building. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="protective">
			<h2> Protective </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> Archery and Gunpowder units receive free city protection and first strike bonuses
				<li> Walls and Castles build 100% faster.
			</ul>
			<p> Protective is the weakest of the traits in the game. It provides little benefit to your economy. If the enemy is assaulting your cities’, that means they’ve already pillaged tiles nearby. In fact, the AI is content with just pillaging than attacking or besieging cities. In reality, this trait was most likely introduced to give the AI some advantage against aggressive players. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="spiritual">
			<h2> Spiritual </h2>
			<ul>
				<li> No anarchy when changing civics
				<li> Temples production bonus of 100%.
			</ul>
			<p> Spiritual is a deceptively simple. On the surface, it doesn’t add much at all. Changing civics without the spiritual trait will send your civilization into anarchy for a couple turns when you could be researching or building your bank. However, the AI will often make demands or requests for the player to change their civics or adopt their religion. Spiritual works best for players gunning for a diplomatic victory as they can appease the request, wait five turns, and then switch back to your original civics. The temple production bonus isn’t too big, unless you need the culture. </p>
